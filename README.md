# wordpress_sub_posts_plugin

This is a wordpress plugin to facilitate using child posts. I use it a lot as the base to make any type of feature where having child posts or multiple posts associated with a single post would be advantagous. For example slideshows, long articles split up into the several smaller articles, photo galleries, etc. This way we can re-use all of WordPress's native post funcationality, like feature images, keywords, custom variables, etc. It's really helpful.
